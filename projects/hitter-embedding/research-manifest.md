# Research Manifest — Hitter Embedding

<!-- STAGED COPY: move this file to ~/hitter-embedding/docs/research-manifest.md
     (the manifest lives in the project repo so paths stay stable and it
     travels with the code), then delete this staged copy and leave only the
     pointer in this project's README. -->

## Authority documents
- `~/os/knowledge/library/baseball-research/Layer1_Architecture_Plan_v2.md` — canonical Layer 1 spec; frozen decision log (§5.13), non-negotiable rules (§2)
- `~/os/knowledge/library/baseball-research/` (Project Handoff v2) — framing, Layer 2 scope, cross-layer open items
- `~/hitter-embedding/docs/` — Claude Code project context

## Frozen rules
1. **Baseline-first gate:** no deep-learning claim without beating bucketed averages, XGBoost, and empirical-Bayes platoon regression out-of-sample, especially in low-exposure strata
2. **Ablation-decided:** every unclear choice settled by ablation on the claim-1 metric; negative results kept and reported
3. **Frozen walk-forward splits:** season splits frozen in config before any model comparison; flag leakage immediately
4. **No luck/price/salary leakage into Layer 1:** never train on outcome luck or market prices

## Decision log
- Path: `docs/decision-log.md` (in ~/hitter-embedding; seed it from the Architecture Plan's §5.13 frozen decisions)

## Lab notebook
- Path: `docs/lab-notebook.md` (in ~/hitter-embedding)

## Library area
- Path: `~/os/knowledge/library/baseball-research/`

## Domain sanity questions
- What is the baseball mechanism? Would a scout, coach, or front-office analyst believe this explanation — and if not, why not?
- Does the effect survive the way the game is actually managed (platooning, deployment/selection bias, pinch-hitting)?
- Is the market claim about measurement-and-identification, or does it quietly assume team ignorance?

## Review bar
- The processed papers in `~/os/knowledge/library/baseball-research/` — rigorous justification for modeling choices, explicit confound handling, clear evaluation design, honest limitations
- Powers & Yurko (measurement confound), Krautmann (MRP-estimate critique) for the economics layer
